      "You're right in the middle of it, you're still going to be hardcore processing whatever is going on, and one way or another, people find peace with things mostly when they are set in stone. There's just so many unknowns in play right now, being apprehensive isn't strange. Leading up to treatment I was really nervous (though sex was better, because it had been stripped of all the procreative pressure) but during treatment I actually felt better, because you're actively doing something. I felt more in control then.\n",

      "It really is terrible what you've been through, but that does not mean your lofe has to keep being terrible. You made the right choice choosing to cut all ties and never second guess yourself on that. Feeling guilty only shows how much of a better person you are, as they cannot even begin to understand that emotion truly. \\n\\nAny parent that can calmly accept the rape and attempted rape of two of their own children (by their own child no less) can not even be called parents in my opinion. It is vile and despicable and I hope your sister is safe. \\n\\nAlso hope you are doing well and can continue to thrive on your own. Best holiday wishes.\n",

      "I lost my mother last year around this time.....take your time, decompress, and acknowledge that there will be a wave of emotions. Don't fight them regardless of how one may want to be \"strong\". They allow for the necessary catharsis.

      "I'm so sorry. I've been there, and I understand. It's OK to break down and feel your grief, but it sucks hard when you have to go back to work like everything is fine. I hope the rest of the day flies by and you can have a quiet evening to feel and do whatever you need.\n",

      "Hey, I know it sucks. I’ve gone through a similar situation. But I promise you it’ll get better! Sometimes the best thing to do is move on, I know it might be hard to accept but slowly it’ll get better. If you ever wanna talk feel free to message me!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing someone so dear to you is never easy. Please know that it is not your fault and she would have not wanted you to spend the rest of your life feeling like you are to blame. It's such a tragedy her life ended so soon. I hope you find peace\n",

      "Hi Sunbbt. As the parent of a first year Eng. student at Waterloo and as someone who has struggled through clinical depression, I also urge you to talk to someone about your feelings. I think that reaching out here and sharing your struggle on this difficult day, is very courageous and is a great first step. Next step: please make a connection with someone you trust and/or the numbers provided by the Campus Police to help you get professional support. It makes me heartsick as a parent to know that you are in so much pain. This is not your fault! I also want you to know that this pain, although it feels intolerable (I know) is treatable and it is possible to go on to experience a renewed sense of joy, peace and purpose in your life regardless of how unfair and rough life can be sometimes. In the past I experienced the despair and emptiness of clinical depression for a period of several years. Thanks to therapy and medication I recovered and have been free of depression for many years now. I am so very grateful that I didn't give up ( although I felt like it many times) and persisted through the process of recovery. My thoughts are with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest and most important thing to remember about situations like this is that it's not actually uncommon for awful, terrible spouses who were absolutely unacceptably horrible to you to, upon being divorced, grow up and learn their lesson and recover from their problems and go on to be a significantly less horrible partner to someone else, and this *does not mean you could have gotten them to do that for you*. Not because you're personally inadequate, but because it's literally not possible; no amount of patience and understanding will work, only being permanently broken up with will work. \\n\\nMarriage is great, but as you say it is a team effort. Don't settle for a teammate you have to *cope with*. Find one who actually improves your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so sorry. You just lost your best friend, that's a terrible thing and it's okay to be torn up about it for a while. Please be kind to yourself, grieve however you will, and talk to someone about it if you truly feel you can't go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't blame yourself. You know that you are not a cruel person in your heart and that her severe cruelty to you brought out the same in return. She cheated on you and then took months to own up to it after the breakup. Move on from this horrible person.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so sorry for your loss. It's never easy, even if it's not unexpected, but losing a parent is the pits. And I think we often forget that grieving is actual, hard work. It's not just something that happens to you, it's an active process that you are constantly working through and navigating, and it takes up a ton of your mental/emotional bandwidth. Don't underestimate yourself, you've got a lot on your plate (and have for a while now, it seems) and you're almost all the way through a PhD program! I don't think you're correctly assessing how monumentally difficult that is, and how much work you've already done to get here. By no criteria is that failure! Be more generous with yourself, it may not feel like it from the inside, but you're doing great. I know it's frustrating to feel stuck, but give yourself permission to feel and do what you need to feel and do. If that is crying a lot, or taking a couple of extra weeks to finish your thesis, that is 100% okay. \\n\\nIDK what kind of program you're doing, or what form your thesis takes (dissertation, body of work, etc.) but would it help to dedicate it to your dad? Even unofficially, just thinking of finishing it to honor his memory might be something actionable, to help you feel like you're doing something/not stuck. \\n\\nI wish you all the best as you move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I definitely understand the guilt feelings. They’re your family and even as dysfunctional as it is we still care. And that’s why detaching with love is so important. It’s not selfish to take care of yourself and support others from a healthy distance. \\n\\nI’m not sure what your relationship with your mother is but Jerry Wise has some excellent videos on YouTube about enmeshment and codependency with parents. In my case, my father was unreliable and emotionally distant so my mother relied on me to fulfill her emotional needs and to raise my siblings. She and I had a relationship built around my father’s drinking and a lot of guilt/shame/resentment. Moving away allowed me to start working on a better relationship with her. Where I treated her like an adult and she didn’t dump all of her responsibility and issues with my father onto me. Me telling her that I wasn’t coming home anymore allowed her to see that she had a choice just like me and decided to divorce my father instead of living with the toxicity and dysfunction. \\n\\nIf you can move out or transfer then you may find that you are more than capable of being independent and setting healthy boundaries and taking care of yourself! And while you’re at it, your college may have mental health services to help! That was a life saver for me when I moved on campus :) best of luck!\n",
      "\n",
      "i really don't think it's going to help you if you frame it as you letting her down.... i've seen you say that at least a couple times in here and i know you're grieving so deeply, but this is not something you should blame yourself for. i also saw you mention that you don't have money for counseling - there are some online places that might be cheaper and might help. i'm really sorry for your loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grief isn’t always rational. Your Dad sounds like he’s in extreme emotional pain and is probably just looking to feel heard and understood. Grief can be overwhelming and so much of it is kept private, it can be hard to share and release it. It’s good that he’s talking about his brother, it’s good he wants to share, it’s better than keeping his pain inside and suffering alone. \\n\\nIt’s okay if you don’t remember, maybe just tell him that you were so little and ask him to share about what his brother was like back then. If you have things to attend to with your baby and can’t listen, then explain as gently as you can and arrange to have a talk when you do have time for him. \\n\\nThis is a massive time in his life. His brother just died, possibly from suicide. His grandchild came into the world. Things are changing and he’s getting old. He’s reminiscing about times gone past.

It isn't particularly common for the state to decide to place children outside the home in this sort of situation unless you are still at risk or you are or potentially neglectful of the children due to your depression and mental health. It can feel overwhelming to face a social worker with this much potential to impact your life while you are struggling with your own issues, so an attorney can help guide you through the process as well as take care of much of the communications with them.

There is a very short amount of time (less than 4 minutes) that the brain can go without oxygen once the heart stops beating effectively.

The way to look at this is to identify that what you're feeling right now is the fight or flight instinct.

Getting out and walking door to door to meet and remind people to vote, talking to them on the phone and encouraging them to vote and even volunteer, or even just helping with cheerful postcards go a long way to directing that fear energy into something positive, and often fruitful. Since you're a service member's spouse, I'm not sure if that would make it different regarding what you can do in local elections, but iirc your help is welcome whether or not you're in your home state (which it appears you aren't).\\n\\n\\nIf that's something you're not sure you can do right now, consider volunteering for something that's not necessarily political. Homeless kitchens and food banks always need help, or helping with a botanical garden, things like that. Heck, even just getting out for a walk every day for a few minutes can help you reset. It's even more effective if you're close to something that knocks some perspective into you, like mountains or the ocean.\\n\\n\\nOur goal is to make it through this while still acknowledging it. If your spouse gets shipped out somewhere, which may very well happen, you have a wonderful support network of other military spouses who will be experiencing exactly the same thing as you.

I've been in your same shoes with a few of my girls; even when they have come back from pneumonia, and they seem right as rain, they've ended up passing immediately over night, just completely out-of-the-blue. Most of the time, with my rats, using antibiotics just prolonged them being in pain. I don't know if you've seen agonal breathing, but it's one of the saddest, most obviously miserable things I've seen a rat go through. You did the selfless thing, what was best for your boy. And I know this may not help much, but for you, he with you for a tiny fraction of your life, but he was with you for the vast majority of his. It sounds like he loved you a lot, and knew he was loved, too. And I hope you were allowed to take his body back, so his rat family can understand what happened to him. Just make sure to take him out a really short time after they've all seen him.\\n\\nGive all your ratties some love for me\n",

      "It is not your fault you were or are unable to “do more” to prevent anything he does, has done or will do. He is not your responsibility, YOU are!!! Take sweet care of yourself, do your best to quiet that voice in your head that says that you aren’t enough or haven’t done enough or won’t do enough. Seek therapy, terrible things have happened to you and finding someone with the knowledge and expertise to help you is the smartest thing you can do. If your car breaks down and you don’t know how to fix it, what do you do? Bring it to a mechanic of course! Do the same for yourself, you’re not irreparable, you can find someone to help you discover new things about yourself.\\n\\nYou’re doing a good job and it’s clear that you know something isn’t right and you’re already reaching out. Take it a step further and find a professional! You deserve that love, attention and are so valuable.\\n\\nKeep up the good work!!!\\n\\nEdit: another though: what a delight to honor your daughter by taking wonderful care of yourself!

Time heals all things, but there will always be scars to remind you of the pain you live with each day. It's important to talk about your emotions; find the things and people in your life that are important to you and help to bring you fulfillment. These will be healthy outlets for you. But everyone runs on a different timetable. Don't let anyone else put a timeframe on when you should be ready to take steps like these. It's okay to grieve and let yourself feel, but when it prevents you from living, even the dead don't wish that for us. I'm sorry for your losses. I hope life is kinder to you moving forward.\n",

You are ultimately not responsible for other people's actions.\\nI hope you can gather resources you need and have courage, I truly wish you luck. Some suggestions I can give you are keeping a diary involving timelines (ideally non-physical, but whatever keeps you safe), stocking up on secret food, talk to a women's shelter/the police for a safety plan, and lastly take care of yourself, even with the little things. In big times, it is easy to overlook your quality of life. You deserve a better life and I hope you get it. Be well. \\n\\nP.s a quote I enjoy: \"because in any one moment we are the sum total of every moment in our lives, on some level, our behaviour makes sense. If may not be functional or make sense in the context of our larger society, but it makes sense given who we are and what has happened in our lives\".

Although my initial instincts are wtf would you want her back, I’ll give you this advice:\\n\\nGive yourself some time to grieve this relationship but stay no contact. Hang out with friends, family, bust your ass at work, bust your ass exercising (worth it just for the endorphins), feed yourself, take care of yourself. Feel proud of yourself. It’ll take time, but you will get into a better place. And when you’re in that better place, two things will happen: either you’ll be a better man and she’ll be a better woman and there’ll be something there, but with more understanding and respect. OR you will be a better man, she won’t be a better woman, and you’ll truly be over her and know that you deserve more.\\n\\nIf she tries to reach out to you, anything less than “I am terribly sorry, I acknowledge these things that I did and I want to be with you and show you I’ve learnt from my mistakes” does not merit a response. \\n\\nNo judgement on what you feel, because you’re in the midst of heartbreak.

The fact that she has a mom who wants to be sober and present says that you are so much stronger and better than that man who fathered you ever was.

It's important to talk with someone about it, to be aware of the trauma reactions within your body and to know which reactions are totally normal.

When I was 16 and he 92 his health went badly down. We had to organize help for him at home and when it got worse decided to bring him to a senior home. As I was the only grandchild still living there and my aunts far away, I was completly involved in everything. He died three days after we sent him there. I've only visited him once during his time there, for maybe 5 minutes. I could still cry thinking about it, I really, really know what you feel like. I sometimes blame myself for letting that old man I loved so much alone in his darkest hour. But I can still remember how exhausted I was and how relieved to give up the responsibility I simply couldn't take at the age of 16. And I know by the deep of my heart that at that moment I simply couldn't do it or I would have broken down.\\nTo come to an end: You really aren't a bad person because you did what you did. There are so many circumstances, so many feelings and so much stuff around in situations like this. Nobody should blame himself for taking not more then being able to take.
