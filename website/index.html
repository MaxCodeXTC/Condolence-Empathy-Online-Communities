            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <blockquote class="intro">I'm so sorry... I don't know what to say.</blockquote>
            <p>
            In times of distress, we frequently go online to seek social
            support and condolence. But effectively providing that support to
            others is easier said than done.
            This study aims to computationally identify mechanisms and
            strategies for delivering effective and impactful condolence on
            social media.
            </p>
            <p>
            We offer the following three contributions.
            <ol>
                <li>
                We introduce a <b>new massive dataset</b> of 11.4M public
                expressions of distress and 2.8M of condolence labeled using
                two deep learning models.
                </li>
                <li>
                Using an analysis of 11.4M expressions of distress, we
                demonstrate that the <b>community selectively engages in
                condolence</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                We introduce a new dataset and model for <b>identifying empathy
                in condolences</b> and, using the empathy estimates, find
                that distressed individuals less frequently offer gratitude for
                deeply empathetic condolences and instead prefer compassionate,
                positive messages.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Code and Models</h2>
            <p>
            Data is available to researchers by email request. Code and models
            are available <a
                href="https://github.com/naitian/Condolence-Empathy-Online-Communities">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Pre-trained BERT-based classifiers for condolence and distress speech, as well
            as a RoBERTa-based model for empathy are available as a <a
                href="https://pypi.org/project/condolence-models/">pip
                package</a>. The code is available on <a
                href="https://github.com/naitian/condolence-models">Github</a>.
            <pre>
            pip install condolence-models

            <h2>Some Highlights</h2>

            <h3>Condolences have a sympathy sandwich.</h3>
            <p>
            If we look at topic distributions across sentences of a condolence,
            the first and last sentences are likelier to be sympathetic, while
            the middle is likelier to be advice or personal experience.

            </p>

            <h3>Some types of empathy work better online than others.</h3>
            <p>
            Our appraisal-based empathy is negatively correlated with a good
            condolence, but a different measure of empathy which mixes in the
            concept of compassion is positively correlated. Full regression
            results can be found in the paper.
            <img src="./img/empathy-regressions.png" alt=""/>
            </p>

            <h3>Either way, refrain from trite sympathy or advice-giving.</h3>
            <p>
            Phrases like "sorry for your loss" or "thoughts and prayers" do not
            a good condolence make. Neither does advice giving.
            </p>

            <h3>Try lexical alignment and person-centering instead.</h3>
            <p>
            Individuals can mirror the language as a way of decreasing social
            distance which can increase trust. This alignment, as well as the
            usage of second person to center the story on the distressed
            individual, are positively correlated with good condolences.

            </p>

            <h3>What else?</h3>
            <p>
            How did we measure "good" condolences? How do we effectively
            express distress to receive social support? How do we detect
            empathy? When do distress and condolences co-occur, and when don't
            they? All of these questions, and more, are answered in the paper!
